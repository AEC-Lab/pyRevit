#### Make Pattern

The Make Pattern tool now has Rotation and Mirroring options (can be used incombination and with Scaling). This will give you more flexibility for editing existing patterns into various rotations and sizes.

#### Convert Line Styles

The Convert Line Styles tool has been updated for a better user interface and more options. The tool is pretty straight forward to use. One thing to note is that the conversions list shows a tree structure with the target style as the parent, since multiple source styles can be converted to a target style in one move.
