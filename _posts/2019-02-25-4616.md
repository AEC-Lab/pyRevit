[pyRevit 4.6.16 is out. Download the installer from here](https://github.com/eirannejad/pyRevit/releases)


#### Keynote Manager

This version includes a few improvements to the Keynote Manager.

- Unused keynotes are not shown as gray (users rightfully commented that they look like they are disabled. [See conversation here](https://github.com/eirannejad/pyRevit/issues/529)). Instead, used keynotes are shown with darker font now.
